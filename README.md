# 🎬 Netflix Data Visualization Project

This project analyzes and visualizes Netflix movie and TV show data using Python, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. It provides graphical insights into various aspects of the content available on Netflix, such as content type distribution, countries producing the most content, movie durations, and more.

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses a dataset named `netflix_movies.csv`. This file taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankulsharma150/netflix-data-analysis/data)

## 📊 Visualizations

The project generates the following visualizations:

1. **Pie Chart** - Percentage of movies and TV shows released by year.
2. **Horizontal Bar Chart** - Number of movies and TV series by country (Top 10).
3. **Bar Chart** - Comparison of the number of TV Shows vs. Movies.
4. **Histogram** - Number of movies by duration.
5. **Top Directors Table** - Directors who added the most content (Top 10) .

Each chart is saved in the `img/` directory as a `.png` file.
